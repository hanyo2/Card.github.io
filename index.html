      <p>More than a mother, you are a friend, confidant, supporter and protector.. and most clearly a patient  Popo and mummy. To still love us fiercely despite the high fire energy that goes on in our home is a great testament to your mothers heart. Happy Birthday Ma! We love you so much ❤❤❤ Love Shu-Wen</p>
      <p>Dear mummy, now that I'm a mum, I'm constantly looking back at my childhood and remembering all the wonderful and energy draining ways you have loved, cared and looked out for me from my childhood till today. You set a very high standard for what I'd like to be as a mother and I hope Hannah will love and cherish me one day as much as I do you. Happy 63rd birthday! May God bless you with many many many more. Love May-Wen</p>
      <p>Hi Ma, Happy 63rd birthday! Thank you for raising all of us with so much love and care, and continuing to show your deication for us so much even after we've grown. I hope you have a wonderful birthday, and enjoy reading this card as much as I enjoyed making it! Love Han-Jien</p>
